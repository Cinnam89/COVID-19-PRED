# Governments Countermeasures Sources

## Intro

As explained in the [main readme](./../../../Readme.md) and due to the large number of countries, here you have the complete list of sources that we've used to obtain our `Governments Countermeasures` features.

It is hard to classify where all the information has been found, so let us explain first the scheme that we've followed:

1. `Lockdown` data has been looked first as our first feature. Therefore, the first Sources list matches this data. However, it's just common that in the same resource we can find information about one of the other features.
2. `` data has been researched for. If it was already available on the first resource that we found for this country when looking for the first feature, it **won't** appear in this list again. If more research was needed, the new resource will be here.
3. Iterate the process until the last feature...
